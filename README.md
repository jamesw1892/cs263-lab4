# Lab 4 of CS263: Cyber Security

My code for lab 4, implementing 2FA in an existing web service.

# Ex10

Implement the `intervals` method in `authenticator/src/main/java/Program.java`. I used methods in the `java.time` package to calculate the current time, find the difference between them and divide that by the time interval.
